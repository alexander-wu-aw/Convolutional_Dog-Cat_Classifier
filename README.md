# Convolutional_Dog-Cat_Classifier
This is my second AI project. It trains a convolutional neural network with images of dogs and cats. It then predicts whether a new image is either a dog or a cat
To help apply my knowledge of deep learning, I created this project as part of a Udemy Deep Learning course.
